/* 
    SET YOUR STYLES IN THIS FILE

    Important notes/reminders/resources:
    * The buildout template can be overwhelming. In my experience the best
      way to figure out how it works is to play around with the inspector
      in your browser on an old buildout and see how things work.
    * You shouldn't need to change any of the styles in the ids.css file — any
      styles added in this file will overwrite those ones if you want to change them.
      But looking through that file will give you a good idea of how the styles are
      working. 
    * Make sure to optimize images before you upload them to CEO or the load time will be massive
    * When working locally on your computer, use the file path of images to 
      insert them (for example: <img src="images/photo.jpg" alt="a photo">. 
      Once you're ready to publish with the IDS, you'll upload them
      into CEO and replace all those file paths with urls (editors will
      help you)
    * IMPORTANT When you're ready to input the story text in the buildout, run the 
      body copy through this python script: https://github.com/carsonology/p-tag-generator
      It will put a <p> tag around each paragraph so you can automatically paste
      the copy into the html file without typing so many p tags
    * If you're confused about Bootstrap, which is where the "col-md-6" classes
      come from, check out this site: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/getting-started/introduction/
    * Make sure to validate your HTML and CSS code to catch any errors
        HTML validator: https://validator.w3.org/
        CSS validator: https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/
    * this buildout template is mobile first. that means design for a tiny screen in the 
      general styles, then adjust for desktop in the media queries (see the bottom of the file)
